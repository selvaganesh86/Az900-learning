securing network connectivity::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

3 key principles: confidentiality(access restrictions), integrity(security in transfer using hashing) and availability (ensure data is availability inspte of atacks)

6 layers: deptth in defense
  Physical security
  identity and access
  perimeter - leverage DDOS protection
  network - limit communications between components
  compute - security to VMs
  application

shared security responsibility

Azure firewall : 
  uses static IP to represent all its virtual network resources
  fully integrated with azure monitor
  high available
  cloud scalable
  inbound and outbound filtering rules
  azure monitor logging
  
  Azure application gateway also provides firewall service for inbound protection of web apps. IT is called WAF - web application firewall.

DDos protection - scrubbing requests
  Basic - automatically enabled. microsoft apps use it
  standard - additional mitigation capabilities
  
  saves from volumentric attacks etc

Network security groups (NSGs)
  filters user traffic
  inbound and outbound rules can be used
  name, priority etc can be used in rules
  
Application security groups ASG

Azure identity services::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Authentication
  - indentify
   - credential request
   -secure identity and access control principles

authorization
  - establishes authenticated entity's level of access
  - what can be accesses and what can be done

Azure active directoty
  - internal and external
  - authentication (MFA etc)
  - SSO
  - B2B
  - B2C
  - Device management
  
Used by IT admin, app developers, subscribers (azure, dynamics etc)

MFA - added security by asking for 2 or more avenues of data. use of biometrics also

security tools and features:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

azure security centre
  povides recommendations
  continuously monitor and assess
  used ML to detect and block malware
  analyze and identify possible inbound attacks
  Free and standard tier is available
  Free is limited to recommendation and assessment only
  standard provides continuous moniorin, threat detection etc

Azure key vault:

  keep application secrets
  secrets mgmt - 
  key mgmt
  certificate management-
  
  Benefits:
    centralized and secured, monitor and administer keys, can integrate with other azure services
  
  Azure information protection - tag it as public, restricted etc
  
  Advanced threat prrotectiion:
    known malicious attacks can be prevented
    
    consists of portal, sensors installed on domain controllers, cloud service  
    it is available as part of enterprise mobility or as standalone license. cannot be purchased via azure portal
