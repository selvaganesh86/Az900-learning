securing network connectivity::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

3 key principles: confidentiality(access restrictions), integrity(security in transfer using hashing) and availability (ensure data is availability inspte of atacks)

6 layers: deptth in defense
  Physical security
  identity and access
  perimeter - leverage DDOS protection
  network - limit communications between components
  compute - security to VMs
  application

shared security responsibility

Azure firewall : 
  uses static IP to represent all its virtual network resources
  fully integrated with azure monitor
  high available
  cloud scalable
  inbound and outbound filtering rules
  azure monitor logging
  
  Azure application gateway also provides firewall service for inbound protection of web apps. IT is called WAF - web application firewall.

DDos protection - scrubbing requests
  Basic - automatically enabled. microsoft apps use it
  standard - additional mitigation capabilities
  
  saves from volumentric attacks etc

Network security groups (NSGs)
  filters user traffic
  inbound and outbound rules can be used
  name, priority etc can be used in rules
  
Application security groups ASG

Azure identity services::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Authentication
  - indentify
   - credential request
   -secure identity and access control principles

authorization
  - establishes authenticated entity's level of access
  - what can be accesses and what can be done

Azure active directoty
  - internal and external
  - authentication (MFA etc)
  - SSO
  - B2B
  - B2C
  - Device management
  
Used by IT admin, app developers, subscribers (azure, dynamics etc)

MFA - added security by asking for 2 or more avenues of data. use of biometrics also
