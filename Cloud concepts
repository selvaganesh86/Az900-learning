Cloud concepts:

key categories: computing, storage, networking and analytics

High availability - low downtime
scalability - increase or decrease resources as per needs. scalability is not necessarily automatic
elasticity - auto or dynamically scalability
agility - ability to react quickly
Fault tolerance - remain running despite failure of component. redundant services take the place of a faulty component.
DR - automation tools to switch over
Global reach - presence in various regions even if they dont have resources in the location
latency - slowness in certain situation can be addressed by having a local presence
predictive cost considerations - cost of services are fixed and known. Take future growth also into consideration
tech skills - no need for infra skills. need only app experts
productivity - no need to rack and stack and patching
security 
Economies of scale
